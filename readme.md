# Text Normalization Challenge - English Language -Overview 
As many of us can attest, learning another language is tough. Picking up on nuances like slang, dates and times, and local expressions, can often be a distinguishing factor between proficiency and fluency. This challenge is even more difficult for a machine.

Many speech and language applications, including text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), require text to be converted from written expressions into appropriate "spoken" forms. This is a process known as text normalization, and helps convert 12:47 to "twelve forty-seven" and $3.16 into "three dollars, sixteen cents." 

However, one of the biggest challenges when developing a TTS or ASR system for a new language is to develop and test the grammar for all these rules, a task that requires quite a bit of linguistic sophistication and native speaker intuition.
